# custom_login_logo
With this Wordpress-Plugin you can replace the wordpress.org logo on the /wp-admin or /wp-login page to a custom logo to personalize the login interface appearance.

You only have to put your png named logo.png in a new folder named "img" parallel to all the themes you have installed in your webspace. You have to create it here: /wp-content/themes/img

In the php file you have to put in your website url to get the function working. After packing it up in a .zip file and then uploading it to your WP-Plugins you have customized the wordpress.org logo with your own one. Nice, isn't it? ;-)

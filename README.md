# wp_custom_login
With this Wordpress-Plugin you can replace the wordpress.org logo on the /wp-admin or /wp-login page to a custom logo to personalize the login interface appearance. A darkmode feature also is on board. 

You only have to put your svg named `logo.svg` in the folder of this plugin and then in the subfolder `/assets`. You can also change the code for png's. 

After packing it up in a .zip file and then uploading it to your WP-Plugins you have customized the wordpress.org logo with your own one.

Additional feauture: `/wp-admin` or `/wp-login` are now in darkmode. This is enabled by default
